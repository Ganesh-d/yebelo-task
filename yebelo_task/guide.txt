after starting the program we simply run our api url into postman for testing.
1) localhost:8080/FetchNextNumber/{categoryCode} -if we test this api with get request then it retun the category code, fetch value and stored value as well

output- 101
	10
	13
2)localhot:8080/{categoryCode} - if we test this api using postman with post api then it update storedValue(next number) it update 13 as 19 accordig to the given condition
